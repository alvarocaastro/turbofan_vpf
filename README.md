# Variable Pitch Fan (VPF) Turbofan — Final Degree Project (TFG)

## Project overview
This repository documents a Final Degree Project (TFG) in Aerospace Engineering focused on a
Variable Pitch Fan (VPF) turbofan. The goal is to organize research artifacts and project
knowledge in a clear, academic format.

## Purpose
The repository is used to capture the project narrative, scope, and methodology for the VPF
study. It serves as a structured reference for research context, constraints, and intended
analysis workflows.

## Scope and limitations
- The repository is a research-focused record of a student project.
- It does not claim industrial certification or validated design results.
- The content is intentionally limited to project documentation.

## Tools and technologies
- Git for version control
- Markdown for documentation

## Constraints
- Only two branches exist: `main` for stable code and `settings` for documentation.
- Documentation is stored exclusively in the `settings` branch.
- This branch intentionally contains only this README.
