# Variable Pitch Fan (VPF) Turbofan — TFG Repository

## Project overview
This repository contains the technical work developed for a Final Degree Project (TFG) in Aerospace Engineering. The project focuses on the study, analysis, and preliminary design of a Variable Pitch Fan (VPF) turbofan, with particular attention to how variable blade pitch (incidence) influences fan aerodynamics, efficiency, and overall engine performance. The repository is intended as a research and development workspace for academic purposes, not as a production or certified industrial design.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the aerodynamic behavior of a fan blade under variable pitch conditions.
- Assess preliminary thermodynamic and performance implications of pitch variation at engine level.
- Develop parametric and numerical studies to explore design sensitivities.
- Support CFD-oriented workflows for pre-processing and post-processing tasks relevant to fan analysis.

## Scope and limitations
- **Scope:** Preliminary design and analysis for academic purposes, focused on conceptual understanding and comparative studies.
- **Limitations:** The work does not aim to meet industrial certification standards or provide full-scale, validated CFD results. Any CFD-related activities are conceptual and support-focused rather than complete industrial-grade validation.

## Repository contents
The repository is structured to support analysis and modeling tasks developed during the TFG. Typical content includes:
- **Analysis scripts:** Python scripts for aerodynamic calculations, performance estimation, and parameter sweeps.
- **Numerical models:** Simplified or semi-empirical models for fan performance and variable pitch effects.
- **Data and figures:** Input datasets, processed results, and plots supporting the analysis.
- **CFD support:** Pre- and post-processing utilities to prepare cases and interpret outputs in a research context.

> **Note:** Folder names and contents may evolve as the project progresses; this repository reflects an academic workflow rather than a finalized product.

## Tools and technologies
- **Python** for scripting and automation.
- **Scientific libraries:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (and related ecosystem tools) for numerical analysis and visualization.
- **Conceptual CFD support:** Pre-/post-processing scripts and utilities; not intended as a full CFD validation environment.

## Intended use
This repository is intended for:
- Aerospace engineering students working on turbomachinery concepts or fan aerodynamics.
- Academic supervisors reviewing TFG progress and methodology.
- Engineers interested in preliminary VPF concepts and exploratory analyses.

## Author and academic context
This work is part of a Final Degree Project (TFG) in Aerospace Engineering. The repository documents the technical development of the study and serves as an academic record of the project’s research, analysis, and preliminary design activities.
